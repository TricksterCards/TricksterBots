This repository contains the source for for the _suggest_ methods of the Trickster Cards bots (computer players) along with a Web API driver for local testing.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio 2019 or 2022
- .NET Framework 4.8
- GitHub Desktop (optional, but recommended)

## Getting Started

Create and clone a fork of this repository from which to submit pull requests. If you're not familiar with GitHub's pull request process
you can learn about using GitHub Desktop to accomplish this here:
- [Cloning and Forking Repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)
- [Creating a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/working-with-your-remote-repository-on-github-or-github-enterprise/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request#creating-a-pull-request)

After installing the requirements and cloning this repository, open the Visual Studio solution file TricksterBots.sln. This will open a solution with 2 projects: TricksterBots and WebAPI.

Bot source is located in the Bots folder in the TricksterBots project. It is organized into game folders. Most games have only file file: *game*Bot.cs.

Documentation on the classes and interfaces used by the bots can be viewed at https://tricksterwest.azurewebsites.net/home/help/BotClasses.html.

## Testing

Local testing is done using the WebAPI project. It contains Web API controllers that invoke the _suggest_ methods on a game's bot. Start this project -- generally with debugging -- and reference it with the bot=_origin_ query string parameter when running our test server at https://tricksterwest.azurewebsites.net/game/.
